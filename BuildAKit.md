## Introduction
Please visit www.westsideelectronics.com/ulcek for full details why certain components were chosen.

This kit is designed to be as cost-efficient as possible without compromising on the quality of the learning experience. That means that anything that would hinder or otherwise break the flow in the learning process is removed.

### Included Components
* WeMos Mini Pro
* DuPont Wires (15)
* Tactile Buttons (2)
* Resistors (330,1k,10k,100k) (5 each)
