## Introduction
Please visit www.westsideelectronics.com/ulcek for full details why certain components were chosen.

This kit is designed to be as cost-efficient as possible without compromising on the quality of the learning experience. That means that anything that would hinder or otherwise break the flow in the learning process is removed.

### Included Components
These are the components that are required to make one ULCEKit. Useful search terms are included in the brackets.

* Potentiometer with Knob (blue)

### Removed Components
* Digispark - programming the ATTiny85 chip was too troublesome and not worth the $3 in savings.
* WeMos Mini V2/Arduino Nano - The driver for the CH340G USB interface caused too much trouble with MacOS devices.
* Normal Wires (circular ends) - The rubber parts tend to separate easily from the female ends.

### Potential Components
* Motors
* Solar panels
* Environment sensors
